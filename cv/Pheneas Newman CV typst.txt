== Projects & Research | #link("https://pheneas123.github.io/#projects")[Portfolio] |

*quantitativelib (Open-Source Library) - #link("https://pypi.org/project/quantitativelib/")[PyPI page]*
- Implements price and returns analysis, Black–Scholes pricing, Greeks, stochastic models (GBM, CIR, Heston, OU, Merton jumps), SDE solvers, and GARCH-based VaR backtesting.
- Built around a single high-level function that fetches data, runs analysis, and produces plots in one call.
- Designed to expose both one-line analysis workflows and underlying reusable components for pricing and simulation.

*Bayesian Regression for Financial Forecasting - #link("https://pheneas123.github.io/projects/BayesianML.pdf")[PDF]*
- Developed a rolling-window Bayesian regression model for SPY returns (2014–2024, ~2,700 observations) using Laplace shrinkage priors and a Student-t likelihood.
- Performed one-step-ahead forecasting with *252-day* windows via 10,000-step ADVI; achieved *RMSE 0.0112*, *MAE 0.0073*, and *53.5% directional accuracy*.
- Used posterior uncertainty to construct probabilistic signals and assessed their out-of-sample stability relative to OLS and Ridge under identical rolling-window evaluation.

*Volatility Forecasting Models - #link("https://pheneas123.github.io/projects/VolatilityProj.pdf")[PDF]*
- Built and validated GARCH-family and EWMA models in R; evaluated forecasts with Value-at-Risk exceedances.
- Automated rolling forecasts and visualised results in ggplot2.
- Found standard GARCH and EWMA performed poorly in likelihood and backtesting; EWMA failed VaR coverage tests, and GARCH underperformed in low-volatility regimes (violation ratio ≈ 0.4).
- Identified GARCH models with Student-t and skewed Student-t innovations as the strongest performers, consistently passing VaR backtests and producing reliable volatility forecasts for risk management.

*Reinforcement Learning for Vessel Collision Avoidance - #link("https://github.com/Pheneas123/DDPG-Collision-Avoidance")[Repository]*
- Designed a custom Gym-style environment in Python for multi-agent navigation.
- Implemented DDPG and TD3 agents in PyTorch; tuned reward function coefficients with Optuna. 
- TD3 model achieved success rate of *90.35%* with a collision rate of *3.65%*.

*Online Option Pricing Calculator - #link("https://pheneas123.github.io/simple-options-pricing-calculator/")[Link]*
- Implemented European option pricing using closed-form Black–Scholes formulas with analytical Greeks.
- Priced American options via a recombining binomial tree with early-exercise logic.
- Implemented cash-or-nothing binary options using closed-form risk-neutral pricing.
